You'll now see performance on the two subsets of your data: the \"0\" slice shows when the loan is not for a home purchase, and the \"1\" slice is for when the loan is for a home purchase. Notice that the model's false positive rate is much higher on loans for home purchases. If you expand the rows to look at the confusion matrices, you can see that the model predicts \"approved\" for the loan 75% of the time for home purchases and only 56% of the time for non-purchases.\n",
    "   * You can use the optimization buttons on the left side to have the tool auto-select different positive classification thresholds for each slice in order to achieve different goals. If you select the \"Demographic parity\" button, then the two thresholds will be adjusted so that the model predicts \"approved\" for a similar percentage of applicants in both slices. What does this do to the accuracy, false positives and false negatives for each slice?\n"
