# What-If Tool TensorBoard Plugin.

The tensorboard-plugin-wit package adds the [What-If Tool](https://whatif-tool.dev)
to the standard distribution of the TensorBoard toolkit, as a plugin.

The What-If Tool is an interactive visual probe for ML model understanding.

The source code for the plugin, and the entire What-If Tool, can be found at https://github.com/pair-code/what-if-tool.

Previously, the What-If Tool source code was part of the TensorBoard repository,
but it has since been moved to its own repository. For that reason, the tensorboard
pip package depends on this package.
